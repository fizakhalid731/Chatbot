Chatbot with Socket.io
I built a real-time chatbot using Socket.io, enabling seamless bi-directional communication between users and the server. 
This chatbot efficiently handles instant messaging, providing a smooth and interactive user experience. 
The project utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for the backend, while the frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This implementation showcases the power of WebSockets in enabling real-time communication.
